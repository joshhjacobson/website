I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Mathematics and Applied Statistics at the University of Wollongong in Australia. My dissertation is in multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling with applications to large remote sensing datasets for environmental processes, supervised by [Noel Cressie](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/noel_cressie), [Andrew Zammit Mangion](https://andrewzm.wordpress.com/), and [Michael Bertolacci](https://mbertolacci.github.io/). A primary focus has been the [estimation of natural carbon sources and sinks](https://www.uow.edu.au/niasra/our-research/centre-for-environmental-informatics/web-projects/global-co2-flux/) in a hierarchical Bayesian inversion framework.

More broadly, my research interests span spatio-temporal statistics and Bayesian inference, including methods for big data, data fusion, multivariate processes, and uncertainty quantification, especially as applied to the environmental and climate sciences. I am also interested in neural inference and statistics of extremes.

Previously, I have also been involved as a data science consultant at [Jupiter Intelligence](https://jupiterintel.com/), where I developed statistical extreme-value models for climate risk analysis. I hold B.S. and M.S. degrees in applied mathematics from the University of Colorado Boulder.
