I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the [Department of Applied Mathematics](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/) at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research interests span spatio-temporal statistics and Bayesian inference, including methods for big data, data fusion, multivariate processes, and uncertainty quantification, especially as applied to the environmental and climate sciences. I am also interested in neural inference and statistics of extremes.

I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the University of Wollongong, where I was advised by [Noel Cressie](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/noel_cressie), [Andrew Zammit Mangion](https://andrewzm.wordpress.com/), and [Michael Bertolacci](https://mbertolacci.github.io/). My Ph.D. featured multivariate spatial and spatio-temporal statistical modeling with a primary focus on the [estimation of natural carbon sources and sinks](https://www.uow.edu.au/niasra/our-research/centre-for-environmental-informatics/web-projects/global-co2-flux/) in a [hierarchical Bayesian inversion framework](https://doi.org/10.1002/env.70052). I have also been affiliated with [Jupiter Intelligence](https://jupiterintel.com/), where I developed statistical extreme-value models for climate risk analysis.

Outside of work, I try to enjoy all that Boulder has to offer. I like to bike, ski, hike, and rock climb—sometimes all in one day! Please feel welcome to send me an email if you'd like to connect.
